# Movies Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a movies dataset, featuring:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with advanced visualizations
- Feature engineering to derive new insights (e.g., profit and profit ratio)
- A preliminary predictive modeling example using linear regression
- Thorough documentation to support reproducibility and collaboration

## Project Structure
- **notebook.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis steps, code, and commentary.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebook (e.g., pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Data Acquisition
**Note:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.  
Due to licensing restrictions and file size considerations, the raw dataset is not included in the repository. Instead, please follow these steps:
1. Visit the [Kaggle Movies Dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
2. Download the dataset and place the CSV file in a folder named `data/` at the root of this repository.
3. Ensure the file path in the notebook corresponds to the location of the CSV file (e.g., `data/movies.csv`).

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LetMeCodeNow-Githob/Data-Analytics-Repo.git
